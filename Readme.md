# Recovering GRUB2 File on EC2 Instance

If you have accidentally deleted the GRUB2 configuration file on your EC2 instance and are unable to boot into your system, you can follow these steps to recover and restore the GRUB2 file.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the AWS Management Console with appropriate IAM permissions.
- Basic familiarity with AWS EC2 instances and the Linux command line.

## Steps to Recover GRUB2 File

1. **Stop the EC2 Instance**:
   - Navigate to the AWS Management Console.
   - Go to the EC2 Dashboard.
   - Locate and select the affected EC2 instance.
   - Click on the "Actions" button and choose "Instance State" > "Stop".

2. **Detach the Root Volume**:
   - Still in the EC2 Dashboard, select the instance.
   - Go to the "Description" tab at the bottom.
   - Find the root volume under the "Block devices" section.
   - Note down the volume ID.

3. **Create a Snapshot of the Root Volume**:
   - In the EC2 Dashboard, go to "Snapshots".
   - Click on "Create Snapshot".
   - Select the noted volume ID and create the snapshot.

4. **Launch a Temporary EC2 Instance**:
   - Go back to the EC2 Dashboard.
   - Click on "Launch Instance".
   - Choose an Amazon Linux or another compatible instance type.
   - In the "Add Storage" step, add an additional EBS volume with sufficient space.
   - Complete the instance launch process.

5. **Attach the Snapshot to the Temporary Instance**:
   - Once the temporary instance is running, note down its instance ID.
   - Go to the "Volumes" section in the EC2 Dashboard.
   - Find the snapshot you created earlier and click "Actions" > "Create Volume".
   - Select the temporary instance's Availability Zone and create the volume.
   - Once the volume is created, attach it to the temporary instance.

6. **Mount the Volume and Copy the GRUB2 File**:
   - SSH into the temporary instance using the EC2 key pair you have.
   - Identify the device name of the attached volume (e.g., `/dev/xvdf`).
   - Create a directory to mount the volume: `sudo mkdir /mnt/recovery`.
   - Mount the volume: `sudo mount /dev/xvdf1 /mnt/recovery` (replace `xvdf1` with the correct device name).
   - Navigate to the GRUB2 configuration directory: `cd /mnt/recovery/boot/grub2`.

7. **Restore the GRUB2 Configuration File**:
   - Identify the missing GRUB2 configuration file (usually `grub.cfg` or `grub.conf`).
   - If you have a backup of the GRUB2 configuration, copy it to the appropriate location.
   - If you don't have a backup, you might need to generate a new GRUB2 configuration. Consult your Linux distribution's documentation for guidance.

8. **Unmount the Volume and Detach It**:
   - After restoring the GRUB2 file, unmount the volume: `sudo umount /mnt/recovery`.
   - In the EC2 Dashboard, detach the volume from the temporary instance.

9. **Attach the Recovered Volume to the Original Instance**:
   - Go back to the original EC2 instance.
   - Attach the recovered volume to the instance using the same device name noted earlier (e.g., `/dev/xvdf`).

10. **Start the Original Instance**:
    - Start the original instance from the EC2 Dashboard.

11. **Verify and Test**:
    - Wait for the instance to start.
    - SSH into the instance and ensure that it boots properly.
    - Test different scenarios (reboot, software updates, etc.) to verify the GRUB2 file is correctly recovered.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you should be able to recover a deleted GRUB2 configuration file on your EC2 instance and restore its functionality. Remember to regularly back up your important files and configurations to prevent such situations in the future.
